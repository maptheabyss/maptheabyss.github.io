	<p>Hi there!</p>
	<p>This is your basic blog highlighting recent advancements in ocean mapping, as well as historical achievements in oceanography. While I expect the number of people this blog will reach will be low, you can expect to update it regularly!</p>
	<p> My blog is powered by jekyll and hosted on github. I know very very very little about both of these environments. So in a way, this blog entirely is a learning experiment for me -- I hope I acquire lots of knowledge! Along these lines, expect the layout and style and even content to change without notice as my expertise grows. Thanks already to <a href ="http://jmcglone.com/">Jonathon Mcglone</a> for the great tutorial for getting this site up and running. Also to <a href ="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, creater of Jekyll (and a general blog inspiration). Last but not least, danke to <a href ="https://zachholman.com/">Zach Holman.</a> I'm expecting my thanks list to grow every week.</p>
