	<p>Hi there!</p>
	<p>This is your basic blog highlighting recent advancements in ocean mapping, as well as historical achievements in oceanography. While I expect the number of people this blog will reach will be low, you can expect to update it regularly.</p>
	<p> This is a jekyll powered blog, hosted on github. I know very very very little about both of these environments. So in a way, this blog entirely is a learning experiment. Expect the style to change suddenly as I tweak and update the code.</p>
	<p> Take issue with my content? Is my editing horrible? Have a suggestion for a post? Want to be a guest author? Email me! maptheabyss@gmail.com </p>
